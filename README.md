# Project Background
In today‚Äôs fast-moving retail industry, data plays a crucial role in helping businesses understand customer behavior, track sales performance, and identify growth opportunities. However, raw data is often messy and unstructured ‚Äî making it difficult to extract meaningful insights without proper cleaning and analysis.

This project was created to analyze retail store transaction data with the goal of uncovering valuable business insights through end-to-end data analysis.

The process includes:
- **Data Cleaning** using SQL to prepare the dataset for analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify the structure of dataset and descriptive statistics
- **Business Analysis** focus on analyzing business metrics and to answer key questions such as:
  1. Which year with the highest revenue ?
  2. Who are the most valuable customer ?
  3. Which product category performed the best ?
- **Visualization** using Tableau interactive dashboard for easier interpretation and communication insights

üßº Data cleaning was performed using SQL queries. The cleaned dataset is available [here](https://github.com/MOZKI/RETAIL-STORES-ANALYSIS/tree/main/2.DATA%20CLEANING).

### Sales Trends:

Although January had more transactions, December outperformed due to a higher Average Order Value (AOV). February showed the weakest performance with revenue of only $37,145 from 304 transactions.  
  
- Looking at daily revenue trends, Friday generated the highest total revenue of $232,786 with 1,729 transactions, followed by Sunday with $225,991 from 1,736 transactions (higher volume, lower AOV). Monday had the lowest performance due to low transaction volume and smaller AOV purchases.

# Recomendations  
- Seasonal peak during December‚ÄìJanuary (Christmas & New Year holidays): Maximize product availability for high-demand categories to capture increased customer traffic and spending.

- April recorded the highest Average Order Value (AOV) due to fewer customers but higher spending per customer: Consider running high-value item promotions in other months to replicate this pattern.

- February showed low transaction volume and lower AOV purchases: Implement bundle promotions or limited-time offers to boost both transaction volume and AOV.

- Clear end-of-week pattern observed on Friday to Sunday: Maximize availability of products likely to be in high demand during this peak period.

- Monday shows low transaction volume and lower AOV purchases: Consider implementing bundle promotions or special offers to drive engagement and increase revenue at the start of the week.
