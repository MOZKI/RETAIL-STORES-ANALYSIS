# Project Background
In today’s fast-moving retail industry, data plays a crucial role in helping businesses understand customer behavior, track sales performance, and identify growth opportunities. However, raw data is often messy and unstructured — making it difficult to extract meaningful insights without proper cleaning and analysis.

This project was created to analyze retail store transaction data with the goal of uncovering valuable business insights through end-to-end data analysis.

The process includes:
- **Data Cleaning** using SQL to prepare the dataset for analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify the structure of dataset and descriptive statistics
- **Business Analysis** focus on analyzing business metrics and to answer key questions such as:
  1. Which year with the highest revenue ?
  2. Who are the most valuable customer ?
  3. Which product category performed the best ?
- **Visualization** using Tableau interactive dashboard for easier interpretation and communication insights
